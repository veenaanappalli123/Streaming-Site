# Contribution and Development Process

## Project Development Overview

This project was developed as part of a second-year academic course. The main goal was to understand real-time web applications, client–server communication, and proper technical documentation.

The project was built incrementally, with continuous testing and debugging at each stage.

## Contributions

The work included the following contributions:

- Backend development using FastAPI
- Implementation of WebSocket communication
- Frontend logic for video synchronization
- Integration of YouTube IFrame API
- Debugging network and synchronization issues
- Writing and organizing technical documentation

Each part of the system was tested individually before integrating the full workflow.

## Development Workflow

The development process followed these steps:

1. Initial project structure setup
2. Backend API development
3. Frontend UI and logic implementation
4. WebSocket synchronization
5. Debugging and issue resolution
6. Documentation writing
7. Final testing and validation

This structured approach helped identify and fix issues efficiently.
